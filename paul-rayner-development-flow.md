# Finding team development flow

- Why we do things ?
 - Rules
 - Understanding and believeing end goal
 - sneaky story myth/anectdote/metaphor
 - Learn to like it
 - short term benefits (but first productivity decrease) 
 - Bad experience not doing it (to me or to others)
 - Imitation

## Event stroming developement flow 
 - first events
 - Add wait state
 - add actors
 
 Count hands off (change of actors) usualy there is a wait state
 
## Asked questions ?
 - Whats the fastest between start and end of the development process : cycle time / lead time ?
 - What if we add a emergency / production bug to correct ?
  - Limit works in progress
 
### Best analogy : 
  - the traffic / traffic jam / emergency vehicules
 
## Search for invisible and unmeasured queues
 
### 1 - Modeling and visualizint your team's development process
 
### 2 - Visualazing + troubleshooting feature development using timeline
 
### 3 - Story slicing techniques to enable smaller batch size + feedback
 - Focus on what delivers value
  
### 4 - Applying system thinking + problem solving techniques to team productivity challenges
 - nonlinear queues
 - delay in causation
 - feedback loop
 - increasing capacity vs reducing congestion
 - align on the goal of the system
  
### 5 - How small improvement in limiting work-in-progress + reducing time spent waiting can lead to major improvements in performance
 - avoid overcommiting
 - avoid wait states (queues) (handoff, batches)
 - cadences for decision / actions
 - introduce wait state
  - managed
  - prior to team commiting
  - prior to constraints
 - reduce time spent in queues
  - $ - â‚¬
  - cost of delay
  
### 6 - Challenges + approaches for limiting work in progress (wip)
 - mindset
  - optimize for capacity instead of flow :(
 - challenge a queue
  - do we need a different / change / ...
 - dedicate staff to interupt work
  - round robin
  - like car pool 
 - Reach constraint (WIP LIMIt)
  - ignore :(
  - go home
  - help someone (start down stream and look for traffic jam)
  - Release flow graph
  - If we could deliver in X days instead of 2x days, what could you do ?
